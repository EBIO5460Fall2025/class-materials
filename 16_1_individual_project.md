# Guidelines for individual project

This is meant to be a contained and tractable project, not too complex. You might need to bite off a small piece of a bigger project.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to make a *data simulation* by devising a model for the data generating process (DGP). This model could range from a model based on ecological or evolutionary processes to a phenomenological regression type of model. There are two main approaches you could take:

* 1\ A fully stochastic biological simulation (e.g. squirrel movement)
* 2\ A deterministic skeleton + stochasticity simulation (e.g. Paramecium logistic growth, linear normal, logit-binomial model etc)

If you **have a research question but no data** you can do either of these. You could use this as an opportunity to plan a study or experiment, or just to organize and explore your ideas. If you **have a dataset already**, you can also do either of these. It will help you build an appropriate model that can be trained on the data to give biologically-relevant inferences.

In addition to the data simulation, you could do various optional extensions, for example:
* Analyze the data from the simulation to check that planned training/inference algorithms work
* Analyze the real data from your study using the model of the DGP that you developed
* Plan a field study or experiment: design a data collection and analysis scheme to estimate the parameters of the model with the required precision

## Presentation

The presentation will be 10 minutes with an additional 5 minutes for questions. An important goal of the presentation is to share your scientific problem and model approach with others so we can all experience the diversity of models and systems encompassed by class members. 

I suggest 4-5 slides.
1) Outline of your study system and scientific question
2) Description of your data generating process model (e.g. algorithm, equations)
3) Example data generated by the model, including variation
4) Optional: training/inference using simulated data or real data
5) Future directions/plans, questions, thoughts ...

## Repo submission
1. `.R`, `.Rmd`, `.qmd`, `.py` document (use whatever you prefer).
2. Any files required to run your code (data files etc). I should be able to run your code to reproduce the simulation.
3. Presentation files.
