### Week 1: Preclass homework for Tuesday

Begin setting up a computing environment. We'll deal with R this week and set up Python and C next.

1. If you haven't done so for a while, update R to the latest version
   * R: https://cran.r-project.org/
   * On windows, I usually uninstall the current R first but you can leave both versions installed.
   * On MacOS or Linux, installing will update your current R installation.
   * I'm on R 4.5.1 on Linux.
   * There is some risk to updating if you have somewhat complex current projects that depend on particular packages, as package updates could break your existing code. If you're worried about that, stay with what you've got. Next week, we'll learn strategies for managing computational environments for multiple different projects. 

2. Install the Positron IDE
   * IDE: integrated development environment
   * https://positron.posit.co/
   * Positron is new but is undoubtedly the future. It has great integration for multiple programming languages and is optimized for data science. It's based on VSCode but brings the best features of RStudio to both Python and R.

3. Get set up with Git and Github. Follow the instructions in
   [skills_tutorials/git01_setup.md](skills_tutorials/git01_setup.md)
   
   Email me your username so I can set up a class repo for you. Then, once you've received an email from me to let you know it's ready, take control of your repo:
   [skills_tutorials/git02_your_repo.md](skills_tutorials/git02_your_repo.md). 

4. Watch the video lecture on "What is an algorithm?"
   * [02_2_slides_what_is_an_algorithm.pdf](02_2_slides_what_is_an_algorithm.pdf)
   * [02_2_video_what_is_an_algorithm.md](02_2_video_what_is_an_algorithm.md) - 8 mins

5. If you're new to R or want a refresher (not a bad idea even if you're a pro and especially if you've only ever used the "tidyverse" dialect), run through the basics of R base
   * [skills_tutorials/rbase01_basics.R](skills_tutorials/rbase01_basics.R)
   * You'll need this dataset: [skills_tutorials/rbase01_cats.csv](skills_tutorials/rbase01_cats.csv)
   * Find a handy R base reference here: [skills_tutorials/rbase02_help_keywords.md](skills_tutorials/rbase02_help_keywords.md)
