### Week 2 Homework for Tue

Before class on Tuesday, you need to watch the video lecture in (2). I will continue from there.

The Git skills in (1) are needed to submit the problem set due on Friday.



#### 1. **Skill of the week:** version control using Git.

In [git03_basics.md](skills_tutorials/git03_basics.md) learn the basics of how Git works, how to make a repository, add files to it, track changes, and backtrack to a previous state.



#### 2. Watch the video lecture: "Selection structures" part 2

* [03_2_slides_selection_structures_p2.pdf](03_2_slides_selection_structures_p2.pdf)
* [03_2_video_selection_structures_p2.md](03_2_video_selection_structures_p2.md)

This finishes selection structures as a topic.
