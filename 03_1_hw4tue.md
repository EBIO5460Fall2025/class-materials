### Week 2 Homework

Before class on Tuesday, you need to at least watch the video lecture in (2). I will continue from there.

The Git skills in (1) are needed to submit the assignment.



#### 1. **Skill of the week:** version control using Git.

In [git03_basics.md](skills_tutorials/git03_basics.md) learn the basics of how Git works, how to make a repository, add files to it, track changes, and backtrack to a previous state.



#### 2. Watch the video lecture: "Selection structures" part 2

* [03_2_slides_selection_structures_p2.pdf](03_2_slides_selection_structures_p2.pdf)
* [03_2_video_selection_structures_p2.md](03_2_video_selection_structures_p2.md)

This finishes selection structures as a topic.




#### 3. Programming problems on selection structures

This is a problem-set assignment. You should submit only one file of R code and one file of Python code. The filenames should be `coding_assignment1.R` and `coding_assignment1.py` but you can add any prefixes to the filename that work with your file naming scheme. **Push your file to your GitHub repository**. To push, you first commit to your local repository, then do

```bash
git push
```

* For R, I suggest you follow the class coding style in [ebio5460_r_style_guide.md](skills_tutorials/ebio5460_r_style_guide.md).

* For Python, follow the [PEP 8 official Python style guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).

* At the very least, these two style guides should give you an appreciation that coding style is quite arbitrary!

You must not use any R or Python packages/libraries for these problems, just straight up structured code from scratch.
