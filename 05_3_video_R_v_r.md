### Video lecture (bonus)

In the house finch example, I mentioned that we have two measures of growth rate: R and r. For those interested in some mathematical biology, this video expands on the connection between R and r. These are fundamental quantities in ecology (growth rate) and evolution (average intrinsic fitness).
