### Video lecture

[Model comparison](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/9027iww8l519qjcl0duor/39-Week-15-Thu-model-comparison.mp4?rlkey=rptgjhtt56l7rh5y3rzvqdvp0&st=u8jdcqdd&dl=0) (1 hour)

* Hypothesis tests for nested models
* Predictive performance, cross validation, information criteria
* Cross validation is a key algorithm in machine learning

There are some slight updates in the code and slides compared to the video but nothing of consequence. I prefer to call this model comparison now (to emphasize that we are comparing multiple models) but it is often referred to as model selection.

The password for lecture recordings is required for this video.
