#### 1. Video lecture: other repetition structures in R

Everything else you need to know about repetition structures. The syntax in the video is R but these concepts apply generally to all languages. I'll cover the syntax for Python and C in class on Thursday.

#### 2. Skill of the week: how to try out new code with Git

When you have an alternative way to do something in code, say for example, a different version of an algorithm, or a different algorithm for the same problem, you can try it out by creating a new branch in your repository. Branches are for coding experiments. If your experiment works out you can merge it back in to the main branch.
