### Week 8: Preclass homework for Tuesday

Ideally, getting through all of this before class would be great (about 1.5 hours total). But please do at least item 1 & 4 before class.


#### 1. Find a dataset for simple linear regression

We'll be doing various things with a basic dataset for simple linear regression, just one dependent and one independent variable, both continuous. This could be data you have now, or from an analysis you've done before, either as part of your research, or in a previous statistics class. Or you could just bring a favorite dataset. The main criterion is that the relationship should be obviously fairly linear.


#### 2. Video coding demo: Linear Normal Data Generating Process

An algorithms first perspective, elaborating on previous Thursday's class

* [08_2_video_linear_normal_DGP.md](08_2_video_linear_normal_DGP.md) (65 mins)


#### 3. Video lecture and coding demo: Libraries, DGP in Python 

* Libraries, packages, modules, package managers in R, C, Python
* Linear normal data generating process in Python
* Using numpy arrays, vectorization, rng for random numbers
* [08_3_video_libraries_python_linnormDGP.md](08_3_video_libraries_python_linnormDGP.md) (xx mins)
* [08_3_slides_libraries_python_linnormDGP.pdf](08_3_slides_libraries_python_linnormDGP.pdf)

#### 4. Install miniconda package manager for Python

* Follow the instructions in [install_miniconda.md](tech_setup/install_miniconda.md)
* Follow previous video to set up a conda environment and install python with numpy and matplotlib
