# Install Python

This will install Python as a regular application. Positron is currently a bit brittle with this installation. It seems to cause error messages or the Python interpreter to crash sometimes. I've found it annoying but harmless. Later we'll also use Python via conda environments, which is said to play better with Positron.



### macOS

The system install of Python on macOS is not supported. Instead, a package management system like  [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is recommended. To install Python using Homebrew on macOS type the following at the Terminal prompt:

````bash
brew install python3
````



### Windows

Install [Python from python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Use the **Download Python** button that appears first on the page to download the latest version.



### Linux

The built-in Python 3 installation on Linux works well, but to install other Python packages you must install `pip` with [get-pip.py](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/#get-pip-py).
